Project Description
Focus Guard is a web-based productivity dashboard designed to help students and developers manage their work environment. It provides a clean interface to track tasks and maintain focus, specifically built for students involved in college.

The Problem Statement
In high-pressure college environments, managing multiple tasks across different platforms leads to digital fatigue and loss of concentration.

The Solution
We are solving this by creating a centralized web portal where users can manage their focus sessions. By using a Java-based backend and a responsive HTML/CSS frontend, we provide a stable and accessible tool for user to coordinate their work.
